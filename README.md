# Theory_of_Languages_and_Automata
These codes are for my TLA course(Theory of Languages and Automata) projects.  
The codes are in branch master and in each folder there is a ReadMe file about what the code does and format of input and output and other discribtions needed.  
There are 5 folders each containing a project, projects are:
- Context-Free-Grammar  
- DFA_Simplificatin  
- NFA-DFA-Conversion
- Turing-Machine  
- Word-Validation-FA  


The codes are in python so you need a python interpreter for running that.

Thanks.
